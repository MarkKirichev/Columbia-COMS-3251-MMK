Since the second and third row of the matrix give a concrete solution to the system of equations for the $x_1$ and $x_3$ variables and in both rows the coefficient in front of $x_2$ is 0, then $x_2$'s value is determined only from row 1. From row 1 we can get the solution: $x_2 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}$. However, that's, of course, given some restriction - namely - to be able to divide by $\\alpha$ i.e. $\\alpha \\ne 0$. In order to cover this \"special\" case, we need to look into 2 possible scenarios:\n",
                "$$\\\\ \\begin{cases} \\alpha x_2 = 0, \u0026 \\alpha = 0 \\\\  x_2 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}, \u0026 \\alpha \\ne 0\\end{cases}$$ It's easy to recognize that the first case will either result in zero or infinite solutions, depending on the value of $\\beta$.

Since we know that for any 2 numbers $x_1 \\in \\R$ and $x_2 \\in \\R$, their product and sum also lie in the set of real numbers: $x_1 x_2 \\in \\R, (x_1 + x_2) \\in \\R$. Since this is true and we are looking for a function that maps $f: (\\R^2, \\R^2) \\rightarrow \\R^2$. Since the input of $f$ is a tuple of 2 random vectors (interpreted as numbers $\\in \\mathbb C$) and its output is a single 2x1 matrix where both values $\\in \\mathbb R$, then the desired function satisfies the condition. =\u003e $\\mathbb C$ is closed under multipliation and addition. Moreover, if we consider the case where we're multiplying a vector by a non-zero constant i.e. scalar multiplication, we can see that this property is still closed under $\\mathbb C$. We can proove this by choosing an arbitrary non-zero number $x \\in \\mathbb R$ and an arbitrary non-zero constant $c_1 \\in \\mathbb R$. Now, we know from the properties of R that $c_1x \\in \\mathbb R$. Now, if we were to choose a pair of arbitrary numbers $x$ and $y$, by the same logic $c_1x \\in \\mathbb R$ and $c_1y \\in \\mathbb R$. Therefore, $(c_1x + c_1y) \\in \\mathbb R^2$.
